# Intuitive Math - Math explained well (or math explained, well, as I see it)
> (Just kidding - doubt I'll explain great lol)

Anyways, this series is intended to be educational to both myself and the reader. I never quite grasped math, and it's only recently I've found my interest peaked up to 11 regarding it. One of the main obstacles in my way was understanding the **use case**, or as we all used to say in school - *"Seriously, when am I ever going to use this?"*.

Turns out, if you wanna do (in my opinion) fun things, like game engine programming (trig anyone?), crypography (algebra YMCA), or generally appreciate life and the mechanics therein (lol), it's incredibly useful in understanding and comprehending *how* to apply your crsytallized knowledge elsewhere.

For anyone who's not come across the term - *crystallized knowledge* (or **crystallized intelligence** as it's typically referred to) describes the *general* knowledge and skill an individual has gained from prior exposure and experiences. Further to this - **how they may apply such to generalize to previously unseen tasks** (humans are the best one-shot learners, eh). It's with this that humans (and generally animals) are able to adapt on the fly, leaning on their encoded knowledge by virtue of experience.

Doesn't matter how many times you smash your head into a brick wall (metaphorically speaking (: ), so long as you get the concept at the end of it, that's all that matters (hopefully that concept's 'smashing head into wall is bad' lol). Of course, we'd rather nobody do that, but as a metaphor for the learning process, it sufficies well in this context - as we all know, extracting and applying this 'general knowledge' to unfamiliar (and thus abstract) domains is harder than you may think.

And that's what math's is all about - giving one a formal method, a *language* to describe the inner workings or mechanics of just about anything. And it's with this abstract understanding you can begin to make sense of your internal mind-map, applying such to even broader domains. In understanding the abstract, we may understand the unfamiliar (aka. abstract) - 'Reduce head hurty', so to speak :D

## Case Study: Music

Let's consider music, for example. Music, much like maths, is a language, albeit to express emotion rather than the abstract. You can express a musical arrangement as a function if you'd like, I suppose (everything is a function, anybody?)... Take for example the good old chromatic scale:

<insert img of chromatic scale here>

> ***Only considering 12-equal temperament in this example, eat me***

Musicians are intimately familiar (aware or not) with the fundemental relationships between pitches or 'notes that sound good in arrangement with one-another', in harmony and melody: ***Musical Scales!***.

<insert example of musical scale here>

> ***Of course, 'sounding good with one another' is contextual - each scale conveys a tone or 'mood'***

And of course, classically, we have the fundemental rule of intervals: The *choice* of each note in a scale is dictated by its *ratio* in accordance with the previous note: **Octaves**, **Perfect Fifths**, so on and so forth.

<insert example of intervals in music>

Intuitively, the chromatic scale, containing "all 12 possible pitch arrangements (or notes)", also contains each scale or *subscale* above. Thus, given the chromatic scale, we can plot each on it like so:

Now I'm sure musicians reading this have heard of Jacob Collier: If not, he's a YouTube personality famous for his (imo) musical prowess and *re-haromization* (that is, transferring a musical composition from one key to another) of familiar songs. Most impressively, he's able to do this *on the fly*. Or well - it's impressive to me, he's very much marmite :D One of my favourite videos of his is this:

Often, he speaks of 'notes having a place to go'. Intuitively, this means moving from one note (or harmony of) to the next shouldn't sound off, or *bad*: A concept known as ***Dissonance***. We all know how bad it sounds, or makes us tense up, when that happens... Totally never happened to me... Of course, as optimally defined by each scale, each note within a scale *always* has a place to go. However, in *reharmonization*, we talk of transferring *between* scales - debasing ourselves a little.

So where do notes go in this instance? Well, turns out maths can help us out here. The mathematically inclined may have noticed already, but the chromatic scale is essentially a **Unit Ring** (or *Unit Circle*, if you will). Here, the unit (Hertz) is divided into discrete categories in accordance with ratios - pitch!. Fundementally, we describe such as a ring due to 


<Describe dissonance, how waveforms that coincide often (and thus, are well-formed ratios of one-another) are dissonant. Explain dissonance in harmonics, chords. Explain how dissonance is used to create tension or create melody in forms of 'steps', how it's almost a form of call/receive or emotional conversational flow. Sets the tone. To transition between harmonic series, 'notes must have a place to go', thus, must have a home in the forthcoming harmonic sequence. Easiest way to do this is to use >

Now of course, a seasoned musician may not (or may - who knows!) have use for this - it's something they've likely acustomed from intuit, an *implicit understanding* of harmonics from experience. But for the unseasoned, or newbies with no exposure, *this* is where maths comes into play: By knowing of similar concepts described by maths (i.e. Abstract Algebra), you can leverage such to accustom yourself/find your footing *quicker* than learning via trial by fire.

There's something funny about the _order_ in which we traverse the notes, especially in relation to their perfect fifths:


It gives a *language*, or means to describe generalized mechanics in the abstract -
